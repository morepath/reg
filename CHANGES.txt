0.9.3 (2016-07-18)
==================

- Minor fixes to documentation.

- Add tox test environments for Python 3.4 and 3.5, PyPy 3 and PEP 8.

- Make Python 3.5 the default Python environment.

- Changed location ``NoImplicitLookupError`` was imported from in
  ``__init__.py``.

0.9.2 (2014-11-13)
==================

- Reg was a bit too strict; when you had multiple (but not single)
  predicates, Reg would raise KeyError when you put in an unknown
  key. Now they're just being silently ignored, as they don't do any
  harm.

- Eliminated a check in ``ArgExtractor`` that could never take place.

- Bring test coverage back up to 100%.

- Add converage configuration to ignore test files in coverage
  reporting.

0.9.1 (2014-11-11)
==================

- A bugfix in the behavior of the fallback logic. In situations with
  multiple predicates of which one is a class predicate it was
  possible for a fallback not to be found even though a fallback was
  available.

0.9 (2014-11-11)
================

Total rewrite of Reg! This includes a range of changes that can break
code. The primary motivations for this rewrite:

* unify predicate system with class-based lookup system.

* extract dispatch information from specific arguments instead of all
  arguments.

Some specific changes:

* Replaced ``@reg.generic`` decorator with ``@reg.dispatch()``
  decorator. This decorator can be configured with predicates that
  extract information from the arguments. Rewrite this::

    @reg.generic
    def foo(obj):
       pass

  to this::

    @reg.dispatch('obj')
    def foo(obj):
       pass

  And this::

    @reg.generic
    def bar(a, b):
        pass

  To this::

    @reg.dispatch('a', 'b')
    def bar(a, b):
        pass

  This is to get dispatch on the classes of these instance
  arguments. If you want to match on the class of an attribute of
  an argument (for instance) you can use ``match_instance``
  with a function::

    @reg.dispatch(match_instance('a', lambda a: a.attr))

  The first argument to ``match_instance`` is the name of the
  predicate by which you refer to it in ``register_function``.

  You can also use ``match_class`` to have direct dispatch on classes
  (useful for replicating classmethods), and ``match_key`` to have
  dispatch on the (immutable) value of the argument (useful for a view
  predicate system). Like for ``match_instance``, you supply functions
  to these match functions that extract the exact information to
  dispatch on from the argument.

* The ``register_function`` API replaces the ``register`` API to
  register a function. Replace this::

    r.register(foo, (SomeClass,), dispatched_to)

  with::

    r.register_function(foo, dispatched_to, obj=SomeClass)

  You now use keyword parameters to indicate exactly those arguments
  specified by ``reg.dispatch()`` are actually predicate
  arguments. You don't need to worry about the order of predicates
  anymore when you register a function for it.

* The new ``classgeneric`` functionality is part of the predicate
  system now; you can use ``reg.match_class`` instead. Replace::

    @reg.classgeneric
    def foo(cls):
       pass

  with::

    @reg.dispatch(reg.match_class('cls', lambda cls: cls))
    def foo(cls):
        pass

  You can do this with any argument now, not just the first one.

* pep443 support is gone. Reg is focused on its own dispatch system.

* Compose functionality is gone -- it turns out Morepath doesn't use
  lookup composition to support App inheritance. The cached lookup
  functionality has moved into ``registry.py`` and now also supports
  caching of predicate-based lookups.

* Dependency on the future module is gone in favor of a small amount
  of compatibility code.

0.8 (2014-08-28)
================

- Added a ``@reg.classgeneric``. This is like ``@reg.generic``, but
  the first argument is treated as a class, not as an instance. This
  makes it possible to replace ``@classmethod`` with a generic
  function too.

- Fix documentation on running documentation tests. For some reason
  this did not work properly anymore without running sphinxpython
  explicitly.

- Optimization: improve performance of generic function calls by
  employing ``lookup_mapply`` instead of general ``mapply``, as we
  only care about passing in the lookup argument when it's defined,
  and any other arguments should work as before. Also added a
  ``perf.py`` which is a simple generic function timing script.

0.7 (2014-06-17)
================

- Python 2.6 compatibility. (Ivo van der Wijk)

- Class maps (and thus generic function lookup) now works with old
  style classes as well.

- Marked as production/stable now in ``setup.py``.

0.6 (2014-04-08)
================

- Removed unused code from mapply.py.

- Typo fix in API docs.

0.5 (2014-01-21)
================

- Make ``reg.ANY`` public. Used for predicates that match any value.

0.4 (2014-01-14)
================

- arginfo has been totally rewritten and is now part of the public API of reg.

0.3 (2014-01-06)
================

- Experimental Python 3.3 support thanks to the future module.

0.2 (2013-12-19)
================

- If a generic function implementation defines a ``lookup`` argument
  that argument will be the lookup used to call it.

- Added ``reg.mapply()``. This allows you to call things with more
  keyword arguments than it accepts, ignoring those extra keyword
  args.

- A function that returns ``None`` is not assumed to fail, so no fallback
  to the original generic function is triggered anymore.

- An optional ``precalc`` facility is made available on ``Matcher`` to
  avoid some recalculation.

- Implement a specific ``PredicateMatcher`` that matches a value on
  predicate.

0.1 (2013-10-28)
================

- Initial public release.
